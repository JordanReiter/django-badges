How to install:
	1. Put the "badges" directory somewhere in your python path
	2. Add "badges" to your installed apps (in the settings.py file)
	3. Define the badges you wish to have on your site in the "badges.py" file of the badges app

	4. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the pre-made badges overview/checklist page, 
		add this to your main "urls.py" file:
		
		urlpatterns += patterns('',
			(r'^badges/', include('badges.urls')),
		)

How to make badges:
	The badges.py file that is included has all the badges currently in use on http://www.otakupri.de 
	for examples. Here is how badge definitions work:
	
	Every badge is subclassed from "badges.utils.MetaBadge"

	Here is an example badge that is awarded to users who fill in all the fields on their profile:

		class autobiographer(Badge):
			model = Profile
			one_time_only = True
			badge_info = {
				"db_name" : "autobiographer",
				"title" : "Autobiographer",
				"description" : "Completed all user profile fields",
				"level" : "b",          
				}
			conditions = (
				"instance.name",
				"instance.about",
				"instance.location",
				)

	The badges are awarded using the post_save signal. So whenever a member of the 'model' is saved,
	it checks to see if the user should be awarded a badge. In this case the model is "Profile" so
	whenever a user profile is saved, the badges app checks each of the conditions and if they are 
	all True, then the badge is awarded.

	The "one_time_only" attribute is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - when it is, it will determine whether a 
		user can earn the badge more than once. If a badge was awarded for writing a post that
		got 1000 views, you may want to award it for EACH post that gets 1000 views, instead of 
		just the first time.

	The "badge_info" attribute defines the information about the badge that will be shown on your
	website:
		
		"db_name" - the unique name that will be used to identify the badge in your database. The
						reason fo this is so that you can change the title, description, and level
						without worry

		
		
		"title" - the Name of the badge as it will appear on the website.
	
		"description" - a short description of the badge as it will appear on the website.

		"level" - badges are either easy (bronze/b), medium (silver/s), or hard (gold/g) to get. It
					would not be very hard to change the levels to something else like numbers.


	Conditions are strings with begin with the instance of the object that is being saved. in this example
	a profile is being saved. So the three conditions are equivalent to:

		"user_profile.name"
		"user_profile.about"
		"user_profile.location"

	...and the badge will be awarded if the following (equivalent) statement evaluates True:

		bool(user_profile.name and user_profile.about and user_profile.location)
